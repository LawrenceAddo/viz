# viz
Simple dashboard builder written in PHP that uses MySQL, Bootstrap, and D3/NVD3 for Data visualizations.

Installation Notes:
Using MySQL create the database and associated credentials, and then run the install_viz.sql found in the install folder.

The default admin credentials are as follows:

     username: admin
     password: admin

If you wish to have some examples/sample data to help you get started, create a sampledb database and run the sampledb.sql.  Then run the tabs.sql and visualizations.sql on the applications database that was installed in the previous step.
